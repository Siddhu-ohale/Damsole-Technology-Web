# Mizzle Website (starter)

This repository holds a minimal demo site for "Mizzle" with a simple layout and placeholder assets.

Structure created:

- `index.html` — main demos/homepage
- `assets/css/style.css` — basic styles
- `assets/images/` — placeholder images
- `js/main.js` — minimal JS (sets year & small demo animation)

How to view:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use Live Server).

Notes:
- Images are placeholders; replace `assets/images/*.png` with real images.
- This is a starter scaffold to build on.
